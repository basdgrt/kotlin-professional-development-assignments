/**
 * There are no tests available for this assignment.
 *
 * 1. Write a higher order extension function on [List<Int>] named [printIf]. The function should
 * accept a [predicate] function of Int -> Boolean. The implementation should print all integers that
 * match the predicate.
 *
 * 2. Refactor [printIf] so it works with all types of lists. In other words, make it an extension on [List<T>].
 *
 * 3. Write a main function and invoke printIf a couple of times on different types of lists
